# Qubtiply
#### A GPU benchmark in Unity

### About

*Qubtiply* is a GPU benchmark that focuses on 3D rendering while measuring the FPS, stressing the GPU in time as the scenes implemented get more and more complex. It  is made in Unity and the source code is implemented in C#. The benchmark contains three scenes that implement objects that multiply after short periods of time and which increase in difficulty as more and more objects appear. 

The first scene contains a pyramid that is made of a fractal that keeps spawning at a depth of 5.

The second scene contains an “atom” like structure to which more and more “protons” and “neutrons” gather at.

The third scene also spawns a lot of objects in a similar manner to the previous scene. The scene implements a “fountain” of 3D objects (spheres and cubes) that seem to burst from the center.
